Enhancing Medical Transcription Information Extraction using Transformer Models and Doccano Annotation Based on Token Classification
As a cornerstone of healthcare documentation, medical transcription entails the conversion of audio reports from physicians and healthcare professionals into text format. It is integral to patient care, research initiatives, and healthcare professional communication (Zeng-Treitler et al., 2014). The lexicon of medical language, comprised of domain-specific abbreviations and technical terms, frequently poses obstacles to accurate information extraction. Interpreting these transcriptions is more difficult by the context-dependent ambiguity inherent to their meanings. (Patrick & Nguyen, 2012).
Natural Language Processing (NLP), a discipline at the intersection of artificial intelligence and linguistics, has emerged as a promising solution to these problems. NLP techniques are designed to comprehend, interpret, and generate meaningful human language (Jurafsky & Martin, 2019). NLP has proven particularly useful in the healthcare industry for extracting information from medical transcriptions and facilitating tasks such as disease prediction, diagnosis, treatment, and patient care (Meystre et al., 2015).
The transformer model, initially presented by Vaswani et al., represents a breakthrough in NLP (2017). This model, which employs mechanisms for self-attention, has demonstrated superior performance across various NLP tasks, including translation, summarization, and named entity recognition. The architecture's capacity to recognize contextual relationships between words in a sentence makes it an excellent instrument for extracting information from complex texts such as medical transcriptions.
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a transformer model introduced by Devlin et al. (2019), has proven to be an effective tool for many NLP tasks. The bi-directional nature of BERT enables a comprehensive understanding of the context from both directions of a word, outperforming other models on several benchmark NLP tests; therefore, it is well-suited for extracting data from medical transcriptions.
In this study, we intend to combine the capabilities of BERT transformer models with the adaptability of the Doccano annotation tool to improve the precision and efficacy of information extraction from medical transcriptions. Doccano, an open-source annotation tool, provides a streamlined and intuitive interface for annotating text data, particularly useful for medical transcription data annotation (Kudo et al., 2018).
Cevik et al. (2022) demonstrated a method for disambiguating medical abbreviations using transformer models. Their work showed a significant improvement in the quality of information extraction, an integral component of our proposed methodology.
As the primary data source for our research, we will utilize a Kaggle dataset of medical transcriptions. Kaggle is a platform for data science that provides a diverse collection of medical transcription data spanning numerous medical specialties and clinical scenarios (Boyle, 2020).
This proposal describes our methodology, from data annotation with Doccano to data extraction with BERT transformer models. It discusses our planned evaluation methods and provides an overview of the anticipated outcomes, potential case studies, and conclusions we intend to draw from the research. It also discusses potential study limitations and future directions.
Given its role in facilitating effective patient care and meaningful medical research, it is impossible to overstate the importance of accurate information extraction from medical transcriptions (Johnson et al., 2016). Consequently, research that improves the precision and effectiveness of this procedure is of the utmost importance. We intend to significantly contribute to medical transcription processing by leveraging the power of advanced NLP techniques such as transformer models and efficient data annotation tools like Doccano.
